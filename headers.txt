Request Headers
---------------
User-Agent: PostmanRuntime/7.29.0
    Lets servers know what is requesting this information: including the application, operating system, and/or version. 
Accept: */*
    Informs the service which types of content (data/file formats) the client can understand. 
Postman-Token: 72455db9-8d99-46b2-b353-56f0903261da
    Postman specific header. It's used to ensure that requests with the same parameters get different responses, acting a bit like a unique key, according to the postman docs: https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/settings/.
Host: www.googleapis.com
    Specifies the host (and port number) to send the request to.
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
    Informs the service which type(s) of encoding the client can understand (typically in relation to compression algorithms).
Connection: keep-alive
    Tells the network connection to stay open after the current request. (A value of keep-alive allows multiple requests to the server without recreating the connection each time.)

Response Headers
----------------
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
    Identifies original content type of the response that is being sent back. "application/json" indicates the MIME type of the file being sent (in this case, that it's a json file), and "charset=UTF-8" indicates that the file is encoded with UTF-8 character encoding.
Vary: Origin
Vary: X-Origin
Vary: Referer
    Most often used to "remember" the content type that the server sent from the list of the types that the client accepted.
Content-Encoding: gzip
    Holds the encodings from the client's original Accept-Encoding list that were applied to the returned message data (and the order) for the client to apply decompression. 
Date: Sat, 22 Jan 2022 02:42:59 GMT
    Date and time the message was created. (Timestamps the message.)
Server: ESF
    Name of software or server that handled the request.
Cache-Control: private
    Holds instructions about how to cache the information sent back. Private says that only the user's local cache should store the information, not in any caches shared along the way.
X-XSS-Protection: 0
    When turned on, prevents Internet Explorer, Chrome, and Safari from loading pages when they detect reflected XSS (0 disables this, which may help to prevent XSS vulnerabilities in newer sites)
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
    Controls if a browser should be able to render any kind of embedded pages (in iframes and the like). SAMEORIGIN ensures that only pages from the same domain can be loaded. 
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
    Used by server to say to use the content types from the Content-Type header should be the only ones used.
Alt-Svc: h3=":443"; ma=2592000,h3-29=":443"; ma=2592000,h3-Q050=":443"; ma=2592000,h3-Q046=":443"; ma=2592000,h3-Q043=":443"; ma=2592000,quic=":443"; ma=2592000; v="46,43"
    Server informing that these other network connections can be treated as authoritative for future requests.
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
    Specifies what kind of encoding was used to transfer the data to the user. "Chunked" allows the data to be sent in chunks, allowing for "streaming" of the response.
